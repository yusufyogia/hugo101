Article Body:
Craigslist is one of the most visited sites on the internet today, with millions upon, millions of visitors a day. With this many visitors
daily, it is very easy to get a nice chunk of traffic with your postings. I have put some tips together for you guys, apply these, and you WILL
make money! 

<b>Tip 1: DON'T POST DUPLICATE POSTS!</b>
Posting duplicate posts will do nothing for you but get your ads taken down.  Yes, it is easy to just copy and paste, and make over 100 ads within minutes, but it won't do you any good.

<b>Tip 2: USE DIFFERENT IPS!</b>
Using different IPs is another way to avoid getting your ad flagged.  One way Craigslist will know to flag your posts is by looking at the IP you are using.  If they see multiple ads from the same IP, they will most likely flag your ad, thus your profits will suffer. (Wait, you won't have any.) One way you can
change your IP is by using a proxy.  If you want a list of them, check out proxy.org.  They have thousands of them.

<b>Tip 3: DONT BE AN IDIOT!</b>
Being an idiot is the easiest way to not make money on Craigslist. Do not post something, blatantly spamming your URL. <b>This is an example of what NOT to do:</b>

"HEY GUYS CHECK OUT MY SITE ITS THE BEST!!!! LOL11!!!  http://myaffiliatelink.com LOL  OK GO THER PLX"

Doing this is also a good way to get banned from your CPA network as well, which also is not a good thing.

<b>Tip 4: CATCH THE CURIOSITY OF THE READER!</b>
This is one of the most important tips of all. By catching the curiosity of the reader you have a much higher chance of getting an email from them, or getting a click on your link.  Also, make sure to keep your ad short - this will help catch their curiosity.

<b>Tip 5: DON'T GIVE UP, EVER!</b>
That's it, DON'T GIVE UP.  Giving up is the easiest way to not make money online.  To make money you must stick with it.  I know it will be hard, but when you finally do get that first sale, or that first lead, it's the greatest feeling ever. If you can do it once, you can do it a million times.

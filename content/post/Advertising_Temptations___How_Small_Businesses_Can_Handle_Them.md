New advertising ideas and techniques most always get the quick attention of the optimistic small business owner.

The first time you hear about a something new to use or adapt, your mind races forward, especially if the testimonials are realistic and seem to relate to what you are doing.

To illustrate, picture that ad salesperson standing right there in your business. 
Temptation is staring you in the face. "It's a great deal," they tell you. Do you go for it or not?

Here are three sets of realistic questions to ask yourself as you evaluate the proposal:

****************************************

1. Take a step to the side and consider this. Is your current advertising already covering the basics? Is this new temptation part of your basic advertising plan or does it fall in the "next level" category? Remember that you've got to do the basics first, just as you have to open a showroom before you can decorate it. So make sure you are doing the basics well before you move to the next level.

****************************************

2. Will the new idea or technique stand on its own as a profit generator? Can the new idea or technique be integrated into your basic advertising thrust so it can compliment what you are already doing? Will it contribute to building a cumulative advertising effect?

****************************************

3. Can you afford it?  Is your advertising budget already strained? Will this advertising method pay for itself? Or will it break the bank?

****************************************

Background: The informed small business owner keeps good records of all promotions and advertising. You want to develop enough information to figure out what works and what doesn't. It's called learning from your experiences of being in the trenches.

Temptation stares you in the face at the least expected times. Temptation can come from hearing or reading about super results others have gotten with their advertising.

Often it appears when a salesperson tells you about the "great deal" they are offering. Temptation can come from looking forward to how great it would be if you could get similar results. It always sounds so easy.

Is temptation worth listening to? By giving yourself honest answers to the three questions above, you'll know if it's time to move ahead to the next level and succumb to your latest advertising temptations.

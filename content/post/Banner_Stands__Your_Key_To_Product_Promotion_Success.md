Successful advertising depends on getting details of your product or service in front of potential customers in any eye-catching way. And whether at exhibitions, festivals, road shows, press conferences, trade shows, fairs or in your own showroom, you need a way to present your goods to their best advantage. This is where the banner stand comes in. The banner stand is a modern tool designed to maximise the ease and effectiveness of promoting your products. 

First, let's look at what banner stands are. In a sense they are miniature, highly sophisticated billboards. A banner stand is essentially a lightweight stand made of aluminium which serves as a frame for you advertising message. This message appears in the form of graphics printed in high resolution on graphic films which are laminated for durability. The best materials for graphic printing is sandtex-laminated polyester. This ensures vibrant colours that won’t fade. 

Banner stands are available in a wide variety of styles including single and double sided banner styles, cassette rollers, telescopic, tension, rigid, motorised and spring. They can be retractable, roll up, or pull up. A variety of lighting options is also available.

Roller banner stands are especially convenient as the graphic panel winds into a tensioned cartridge in the base. Cartridge banner stands feature a swappable cartridge allowing the advertising graphics to be changed in an instant. This is great for when you need to tailor your message to suit local requirements. They are also perfect for when you need to promote a range of different products or if you attend many events and need to switch between products efficiently.

Motorised banner stands present long messages via a steadily rotating panel. These can communicate long texts effectively.

For outdoor exhibitions, special outdoor banner stands are available. For these you need to fill their bases with sand or water to ensure their stability.

One great thing about banner stands is their versatility. They can be positioned individually or tiled for extra impact. If you need a large display, you can arrange a group of stands to best suit your needs. Banner stands can work alone or be used together with other promotional methods such as a trade show display. You could for example set one up in the lobby or meeting hall at an exhibition. Or you could put one up at the end of an aisle to attract visitors to your booth. And they're convenient too. They simply retract into their base for easy and secure transportation. Assembly and disassembly is a snap.

If you need to get your product before as many eyes as possible with efficiency, versatility and at a low cost, look into using banner stands. Not only are they visually attractive but their portability and ease of setup makes your job so much easier. Their durability means that they can be used over and over again. And of course they're a great way to generate interest in your product or service.

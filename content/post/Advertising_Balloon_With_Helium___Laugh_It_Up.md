I really am a throw back.  In this day and age of Washington Concensus minded, self-persevering valued folks, I’m just an old fashioned egalitarian.  This doesn’t mean that I think we should all sew up some Mao-style unisex suits and eat from cans labeled in black in white.  It just means that I don’t think that the playing field is level and it needs to be and then measures need to be enacted to maintain equal opportunity.  Well it means some other things too, but that’s neither her nor there for this little chat.  In the end, my support for equality comes down to equal opportunity and respect.  And that’s how I try to approach people today.

I feel that everyone has something positive to share with me and the world and I try to approach all in this manner until proven otherwise.  I have spent time with some wonderfully intelligent and caring wealthy people and I certainly have ample experiences of sharing time with those less fortunate that have taught me much about life with their wisdom, patience and sense of humor.

This is why I like balloons.  I feel like their the egalitarian activist in the world of toys and advertising.  So many other toys and advertising gimmicks typically associate themselves with one segment of society or another.  This is not the case with balloons.  

Although balloons boast an incredibly low and anachronistic price, both rich and poor kids want them at their party.  Middle school kids still let off balloons to carry messages of goodwill to its unknown recipient.  Even Colombian mules count on balloons as an integral part of their import/export businesses.

So, if you truly believe in equality, put your money where your mouth is and drop socially stratifying toys like PlayStation or Homies and get yourself some balloons.  Let’s play and advertise in solidarity.  Land, Liberty, Balloons!

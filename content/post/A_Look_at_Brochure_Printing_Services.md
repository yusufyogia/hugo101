A brochure can be a wonderful promotional tool for a wide range of professionals, but getting them set up can be daunting.  There are many brochure-printing services available that cater to both the amateur and professional. You can find them in a number of ways, including the phone book, the Internet, graphic design and advertising journals, or word of mouth.

Some companies will provide typesetting, design, color separations (four-color process), color proofing and proofreading service, while other companies just provide the most basic color printing, folding and shipping. 

There are brochure-printing companies that will do everything for you; all you need is a clear idea of your brochure’s requirements and whether it is business, promotional or another application, and the brochure company will take it from start to finish.  Brochure design can be a challenge, so you might consider working with the professional designer that many brochure-printing companies offer. Some companies even offer sales literature development assistance and strategic marketing plans. However if you do your own design, copy writing, typesetting and art placement, and use these services sparingly, you will save money. One thing to keep in mind if you choose to do so is that most basic brochure printing companies will warn you that they will not proof read your work, and that corrections cost extra. 

If you simply start at the beginning with a step-by-step review of your needs, many companies will walk you through the features and benefits of their products and services. Because there is so much competition, many services (such as shipping) are offered at a discount or even free. Furthermore, most brochure printing companies will provide their own customer service representative who will work closely with you to make sure your job runs smoothly and efficiently through the entire process, from pre-press to final distribution. 

You should investigate thoroughly each brochure printing company and the services they offer to make sure they meet your requirements.  A well-designed brochure can work wonders, and are well worth the effort.

So you are an internet marketer and you want to make money right? Or maybe you are just somebody with a product or service to sell that is looking for innovative ways to get your stuff in front of more customers eyes and increasing the size of your market share. Either way you have come to the right place to read about an excellent form of advertising called banner advertising that takes advantage of the wave of the future—the internet. The internet allows your market to instantly be any where in the world that there is a computer and that you can then ship your product or provide your service. Now some of the more traditional type services like doctors, plumbers, etc. will be limited by the geography naturally but this is still a great way to advertise in your area as more and more people are getting on the internet daily.

What is banner advertising you say? Well it is an ad that is placed on a website that is not related to the ad but preferably is one that lots of people will hit. It is an ad that usually is in some sort of image file and often contains typical words and pictures as well as animation and sound which are becoming popular “hooking” techniques. The ad is usually short and wide or tall and narrow and this is why it is referred to as a banner. When a customer wants to see more they simply click on the banner and are taken via an embedded link to another page which is typically the sales page. If the product is something that you can purchase online or download it is done through this page. Otherwise it is just more exposure for the advertiser.

Another good question is why would the host website allow the ad to be on their page? Well just like any form of advertising the advertiser pays for time or in this case space. Most often with banner advertising the deal is worked out according to how many clickthroughs happen in a given amount of time. Usually the cost is five to ten cents per click.

How would I get my advertisement on a page? Well again just like other forms of advertising there are many ways to do it. You could personally contact the owner or operator of the site and work out a deal, or you could hire and advertising firm that does all of that work for you. Most often it is this second form that is used and these advertising companies will place the ad on multiple different sites and collect the fees, and paying the site’s owner or operator.

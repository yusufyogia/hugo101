Your business brochure is a ferociously powerful advertising and marketing tool. It pays to produce it tastefully. The biggest is not always the best and use it wisely if you wish to see your business grow. However, the best-produced brochure on the planet is going to be useless unless it is distributed effectively. So what is the key to effective distribution?

The first step often is direct mailing. You post out the leaflet to a mass of people usually using a mailing list you have purchased. Mass mailings are very inefficient and if you get more than 1% response you are doing well. This can be an expensive way of doing business.

Second, you could hire people to distribute the brochures in shopping mall parking lots. This can be even more wasteful than a mailing, with many of the leaflets tossed aside. The ensuing mess will probably irritate more people than it attracts.

Third, you could get your publication out to the masses by using a local newspaper whereby your brochures are placed in the journal and delivered to subscribers. This has a similar effect to advertising and probably has a comparable response rate.

Fourth, place the pamphlets in plastic holders and have them readily available to those who visit your site of work. Shame on you if you have not done this already.

Fifth, have the printed matter at hand in places where people have to wait in line for a service such as in the post office. Those waiting have nothing better to do than read your message and this could be useful publicity. The Post Office has already thought of this and will charge you accordingly.

Sixth, dentists’ and doctors’ waiting rooms have a similar trapped audience who might take the time to read what you have to say. Generally, the medical profession will probably only allow material that is somehow pertinent to their line of work. However, this one is worth a try.

Number seven – distribute your promotion material widely at trade shows and exhibitions. Assuming the show is relevant to your line of business, there is a good likelihood that this would be a great source for prospects.

Eighth. Place your brochure on your website so that prospects can instantly download it after supplying their contact information. This is a great way too of building up a valuable prospect list so that you can market to them over and over.

Ninth. Use the brochure in place of a business card. True a brochure is a lot bigger than a card and might get thrown away, but here is a challenge. Why not design something that contains your principal message in a smaller format?

Tenth: Surely you have a database of all your clients past and present? This is the seam of gold for your enterprise, so mail out a current brochure to all of them. If you have done a good job in the past you may be agreeably surprised by the response.

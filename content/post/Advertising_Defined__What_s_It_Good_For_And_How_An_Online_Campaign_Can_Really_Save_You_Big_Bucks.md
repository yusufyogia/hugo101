Article Body:
A variety of definitions of advertising exist but the best I've found yet to cover what advertising is can be summed up in the following 2 statements:

ad•ver•tis•ing   n.: The activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media.

Also defined as "the non personal communication of information through various media, paid for by the advertiser and is usually convincing in nature about the need to buy products and services" - the advertisers of course.	

Advertising your company’s products and services to your targeted audience is essential to maintain a long lasting and prosperous relationship. If you’re not continually winning your customers over than the competition will. 

So, What Does An Advertising Agency Do?

If your business can afford it an advertising agency will really help you allot. Advertising agencies spend all day long just doing advertising for various businesses. They will already know the cost/thousand numbers of the various media available in your area, they'll also have a good idea of what will or will not work well for your type of business. This will come at a price but will definitely be the short track to your businesses success, unless your time is not worth much to you, and in that case go ahead and waste it if you'd like. (:--) A successful advertising campaign will strongly depend on how the advertising agency has designed your advertisements; therefore I've provided the following help.

Tips For Choosing An Advertising Agency 1) The popularity and reputation of the advertising agency 2) The charges / work ration of the advertising agency 3) The working efficiency of the advertising agency

The longevity and overall success of your business can be obtained by the help of a good advertising agency saving you precious time and huge amounts of money should you not know what your doing.

The Latest Types Of Advertising

Now a days advertising on the internet has become a very popular and effective tool to promote and reach your target audience. Known as digital advertising, pay per click advertising or internet advertising marketing, the benefits are huge. Considering the cost savings of knowing ahead of time what the consumer response of one advertisement over the other is will be essential information to a great ad campaign. 

With an online advertising campaign you have the immediate benefit of testing of your campaign rather than waiting till it's over with traditional media. Through text advertisement programs like Google Adwords for example you can have a campaign up and running within minutes to test how well various words will be clicked. You can than test this further to ensure the clients that are going to your site are the type of customers you want and not just "tire kickers" so to speak. 

Once your online advertisement campaign is able to draw the right clientele you'll be in a better position to launch an offline, more expensive traditional style advertising campaign. 

An online advertising agency can help you plan, design and implement internet advertising of your products and services to take the confusion out of the web if online advertising is new to you.   

Many advertising careers exist and have for years. With the advent of the net of course a new stream of advertising career has been opened up for those desiring to work from their computer rather than the traditional face to face approach. Myself, I recommend a combination of both online and offline for total success of your business.

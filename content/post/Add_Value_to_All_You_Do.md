Article Body:
While reading some very informative material recently, I found myself inspired by a concept that enables a person to soar to higher heights.  The concept of adding value to everything you do, when applied to specific areas of a person's life, can bring that person to be highly sought after by those receiving the added value.  The material I was reading focused on business and what this concept will do for the success of a business.  Another way of looking at this concept is in the idea of doing more than is expected, or doing more than that which you are compensated to do.  When doing this a person will be "weighed" against others who do not.  In comparison, the person who adds value to all he/she does will be sought after to the degree that there will be keen competition for his/her service.  As a person becomes more and more recognized for doing more than he/she is compensated to do, he/she will begin receiving more and more compensation for their services.  

There is an additional benefit that comes to the person who exercises this concept in his/her business; the development of that person's strength.  In nature, do you suppose the strongest trees are those that are protected from the storms and hidden from the sun?  This isn't the case.  The one that stands out in the open and bears all of the winds and rain and is shone upon by the blistering sun is the tree that develops the strength to withstand  the most violent weather.  This also is the case for the person who goes beyond expectation to deliver added value in everything he/she does.  This is the person that becomes strong enough to succeed despite the adversities that one is sure to come up against in his/her business.  The fact that most people are delivering as little as they can get by with, serves as a great advantage to you when you deliver added value.  One who delivers as little as he/she can, may rest assured he/she will receive the same.  

I hope this information will add value to all of your experiences.    
Joe Clinton.
